Recently, there has been considerable interest in using planar structures, referred to as metasurfaces, to construct flat optical components for manipulating light in unusual ways. Here, we propose and demonstrate the concept of a planar immersion lens based on metasurfaces. The resulting planar device, when placed near an interface between air and dielectric material, can focus electromagnetic radiation incident from air to a spot in the material smaller than the free-space wavelength. As an experimental demonstration, we fabricate an ultrathin and flexible microwave lens and further show that it achieves wireless energy transfer in material mimicking biological tissue.}},

At higher frequencies, the optimal current distribution is shown to induce fields that exhibit focusing. The effects of constructive and destructive interference substantially improves the power transfer efficiency and reinforces operation in the low GHz-range.

Here, we describe the design and operation of conformal electromagnetic structures, termed phased surfaces, that interface with non-planar body surfaces and optimally modulate the phase response to enhance the performance of wireless powering. We demonstrate that the phased surfaces can wirelessly transfer energy across anatomically heterogeneous tissues in large animal models, powering miniaturized semiconductor devices (<12 mm3) deep within the body (>4 cm). As an illustration of in vivo operation, we wirelessly regulated cardiac rhythm by powering miniaturized stimulators at multiple endocardial sites in a porcine animal model. A phased electromagnetic surface that conforms to the body surface can regulate cardiac rhythm in a porcine model through the wireless transmission of power to miniaturized semiconductor devices implanted at depths of over 4 cm.}},

Here, we report energy-efficient and secure wireless body sensor networks that are interconnected through radio surface plasmons propagating on metamaterial textiles. The approach uses clothing made from conductive fabrics that can support surface-plasmon-like modes at radio communication frequencies. Our body sensor networks enhance transmission efficiencies by three orders of magnitude compared to conventional radiative networks without the metamaterial textile, and confine wireless communication to within 10 cm of the body. We also show that the approach can offer wireless power transfer that is robust to motion and textile-based wireless touch sensing.

Here, we report near-field-enabled clothing capable of establishing wireless power and data connectivity between multiple distant points around the body to create a network of battery-free sensors interconnected by proximity to functional textile patterns. Using computer-controlled embroidery of conductive threads, we integrate clothing with near-field-responsive patterns that are completely fabric-based and free of fragile silicon components. We demonstrate the utility of the networked system for real-time, multi-node measurement of spinal posture as well as continuous sensing of temperature and gait during exercise.

abstract = {{Monitoring surgical wounds post-operatively is necessary to prevent infection, dehiscence and other complications. However, the monitoring of deep surgical sites is typically limited to indirect observations or to costly radiological investigations that often fail to detect complications before they become severe. Bioelectronic sensors could provide accurate and continuous monitoring from within the body, but the form factors of existing devices are not amenable to integration with sensitive wound tissues and to wireless data transmission. Here we show that multifilament surgical sutures functionalized with a conductive polymer and incorporating pledgets with capacitive sensors operated via radiofrequency identification can be used to monitor physicochemical states of deep surgical sites. We show in live pigs that the sutures can monitor wound integrity, gastric leakage and tissue micromotions, and in rodents that the healing outcomes are equivalent to those of medical-grade sutures. Battery-free wirelessly operated bioelectronic sutures may facilitate post-surgical monitoring in a wide range of interventions. Multifilament surgical sutures functionalized with a conductive polymer and incorporating pledgets with capacitive sensors operated via radiofrequency identification can be used to monitor physicochemical states of deep surgical sites.}},

They are critical components in modern research and clinical neurotechnologies and play a central role in determining their overall size, lifetime and functionality. Wireless interfaces use a wide range of modalitiesincluding radio-frequency fields, acoustic waves and lightto transfer energy and data to and from an implanted device. These forms of energy interact with living tissue through distinct mechanisms and therefore lead to systems with vastly different form factors, operating characteristics, and safety considerations. This paper reviews recent advances in the development of wireless interfaces for brain neurotechnologies. We summarize the requirements that state-of-the-art brain-implanted devices impose on the wireless interface, and discuss the working principles and applications of wireless interfaces based on each modality. We also investigate challenges associated with wireless brain neurotechnologies and discuss emerging solutions permitted by recent developments in electrical engineering and materials science.

We develop a procedure to systematically synthesize these metasurfaces using multilayer tissue model that can account for different body compositions. Using this procedure, we design a three-layer metasurface operating at 2.45 GHz with λ/24.5 thickness. Full-wave simulations in a computational human body model show that the metasurface provides transmission equivalent to replacing the background with a tissue-matched medium, while experimental measurements demonstrate 12.1 dB enhancement of transmission into a multilayer tissue phantom.}},

The sensor (13 cm2 in size) comprises a radial pattern of grooves that support spoof localized surface plasmon (LSP) modes and a ground plane with a complementary window that controls the sensor’s interaction with the body. These spoof LSP modes provide a sharp resonant dip and a broadly tunable evanescent field that enables tracking of heartbeat and respiration via the |S11| spectrum measured in a connector-free manner. We establish the optimal operating mode of the sensor and show that it provides a resonant frequency shift of 250 MHz for respiration and 100 MHz for heartbeat motions.

To ease and to expedite their deployment, here, we identify bottlenecks hindering the maturation of flexible sensors and propose promising solutions. We first analyze challenges in achieving satisfactory sensing performance for real-world applications and then summarize issues in compatible sensor-biology interfaces, followed by brief discussions on powering and connecting sensor networks. Issues en route to commercialization and for sustainable growth of the sector are also analyzed, highlighting environmental concerns and emphasizing nontechnical issues such as business, regulatory, and ethical considerations.

Demonstrations using a wearable wireless sensor show that the stochastic exceptional points lead to more accurate tracking of a person’s vital signs during exercise.

The textiles facilitate non-radiative propagation of radio-frequency signals along the surface of the body, passively amplifying the received signal strength by more than three orders of magnitude (>30 dB) compared to without the textile.
