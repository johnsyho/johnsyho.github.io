Recently, there has been considerable interest in using planar structures, referred to as metasurfaces, to construct flat optical components for manipulating light in unusual ways. Here, we propose and demonstrate the concept of a planar immersion lens based on metasurfaces. The resulting planar device, when placed near an interface between air and dielectric material, can focus electromagnetic radiation incident from air to a spot in the material smaller than the free-space wavelength.

We demonstrate that the phased surfaces can wirelessly transfer energy across anatomically heterogeneous tissues in large animal models, powering miniaturized semiconductor devices (<12 mm3) deep within the body (>4 cm). As an illustration of in vivo operation, we wirelessly regulated cardiac rhythm by powering miniaturized stimulators at multiple endocardial sites in a porcine animal model.

Here, we report energy-efficient and secure wireless body sensor networks that are interconnected through radio surface plasmons propagating on metamaterial textiles. The approach uses clothing made from conductive fabrics that can support surface-plasmon-like modes at radio communication frequencies. Our body sensor networks enhance transmission efficiencies by three orders of magnitude compared to conventional radiative networks without the metamaterial textile, and confine wireless communication to within 10 cm of the body. We also show that the approach can offer wireless power transfer that is robust to motion and textile-based wireless touch sensing.

Equipping intelligent human-like androids and prosthetics with electronic skins—a large array of sensors spatially distributed and capable of rapid somatosensory perception—will enable them to work collaboratively and naturally with humans to manipulate objects in unstructured living environments. Previously reported tactile-sensitive electronic skins largely transmit the tactile information from sensors serially, resulting in readout latency bottlenecks and complex wiring as the number of sensors increases. Here, we introduce the Asynchronously Coded Electronic Skin (ACES)—a neuromimetic architecture that enables simultaneous transmission of thermotactile information while maintaining exceptionally low readout latencies, even with array sizes beyond 10,000 sensors. We demonstrate prototype arrays of up to 240 artificial mechanoreceptors that transmitted events asynchronously at a constant latency of 1 ms while maintaining an ultra-high temporal precision of <60 ns, thus resolving fine spatiotemporal features necessary for rapid tactile perception. Our platform requires only a single electrical conductor for signal propagation, realizing sensor arrays that are dynamically reconfigurable and robust to damage. We anticipate that the ACES platform can be integrated with a wide range of skin-like sensors for artificial intelligence (AI)–enhanced autonomous robots, neuroprosthetics, and neuromorphic computing hardware for dexterous object manipulation and somatosensory perception.}},

However, this task is challenging because the conventional materials (e.g., papers and plastics) for building origami robots lack design opportunities for incorporating add-on functionalities. Installing external electronics requires high system integration and inevitably increases the robotic weight. Here, a graphene oxide (GO)–enabled templating synthesis was developed to produce reconfigurable, compliant, multifunctional metallic backbones for the fabrication of origami robots with built-in strain sensing and wireless communication capabilities. The GO-enabled templating synthesis realized the production of complex noble metal origamis (such as Pt) with high structural replication of their paper templates. The reproduced Pt origami structures were further stabilized with thin elastomer, and the Pt-elastomer origamis were reconfigurable and served as the multifunctional backbones for building origami robots. Compared with traditional paper and plastic materials, the reconfigurable Pt backbones were more deformable, fire retardant, and power efficient. In addition, the robots with conductive Pt-elastomer backbones (Pt robots) demonstrated distinct capabilities—such as on-demand resistive heating, strain sensing, and built-in antennas—without the need for external electronics. The multifunctionality of Pt robots was further demonstrated to extend beyond the capabilities of traditional paper-based robots, such as melting an ice cube to escape, monitoring/recording robotic motions in real time, and wireless communications between robots. The development of multifunctional metallic backbones that couple actuation, sensing, and communication enriches the material library for the fabrication of soft robotics toward high functional integration.</p>}},

abstract = {{Networks of sensors placed on the skin can provide continuous measurement of human physiological signals for applications in clinical diagnostics, athletics and human-machine interfaces. Wireless and battery-free sensors are particularly desirable for reliable long-term monitoring, but current approaches for achieving this mode of operation rely on near-field technologies that require close proximity (at most a few centimetres) between each sensor and a wireless readout device. Here, we report near-field-enabled clothing capable of establishing wireless power and data connectivity between multiple distant points around the body to create a network of battery-free sensors interconnected by proximity to functional textile patterns. Using computer-controlled embroidery of conductive threads, we integrate clothing with near-field-responsive patterns that are completely fabric-based and free of fragile silicon components. We demonstrate the utility of the networked system for real-time, multi-node measurement of spinal posture as well as continuous sensing of temperature and gait during exercise. Though wireless near-field communication (NFC) technologies that connect wearable sensors for health monitoring have been reported, the short range of NFC readers limits sensor functionality. Here, the authors report a wireless and battery-free body sensor network with near-field-enabled clothing.}},

The grand challenge for mimicking such natural intelligence in miniature robots lies in achieving highly integrated body functionality, actuation, and sensing mechanisms. Here, somatosensory light‐driven robots (SLiRs) based on a smart thin‐film composite tightly integrating actuation and multisensing are presented. The SLiR subsumes pyro/piezoelectric responses and piezoresistive strain sensation under a photoactuator transducer, enabling simultaneous yet non‐interfering perception of its body temperature and actuation deformation states. The compact thin film, when combined with kirigami, facilitates rapid customization of low‐profile structures for morphable, mobile, and multiple robotic functionality. For example, an SLiR walker can move forward on different surfaces, while providing feedback on its detailed locomotive gaits and subtle terrain textures, and an SLiR anthropomorphic hand shows bodily senses arising from concerted mechanoreception, thermoreception, proprioception, and photoreception. Untethered operation with an SLiR centipede is also demonstrated, which can execute distinct, localized body functions from directional motility, multisensing, to wireless human and environment interactions. This SLiR, which is capable of integrated perception and motility, offers new opportunities for developing diverse intelligent behaviors in soft robots.

Still, challenges remain in the fabrication of solar evaporation devices with synergistic performance in a scalable fashion. Herein, we develop a scalable fabrication process involving multi-scale and multi-interface engineering to achieve high-performance and large-area solar evaporation devices. At nanoscale, light-absorbing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are complexed with hydrophilic cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) to form the nanocomposite inks of CNT-CNF (c-CNT) with tunable viscosity for doctor blading on ethanol-diffused polystyrene (E-PS) films. Through one-step thermal treatment, device shrinkage and substrate foaming are triggered at multi-interfaces to synchronously induce (1) the creation of microscale crumpled c-CNT textures with dual-improved water supply and light absorption and (2) the generation of mesoscale pores in PS substrates with dual-suppressed thermal conduction and radiation. Contributed by the synergistic designs, the solar evaporation device demonstrates a high evaporation rate of 1.41 kg m−2 h−1 and a conversion efficiency of 95.8\% at an extremely low loading of photothermal materials (0.25 mg cm−2). A large-area solar evaporation panel is realized to highlight the practical consideration toward more impactful solar evaporation exploitation.}},

The IEAD acquires intramuscular EMG signals at 17.85 kspselectrode while being powered transcutaneously by the ITM using 22 MHz near-field inductive coupling. The acquired EMG data is transmitted transcutaneously via NIR telemetry to the ITM, which in turn, transfers the data to the RaspDAQ for relaying to a laptop computer for display and storage. We have also validated the complete system by acquiring EMG signals from rodents for up to two months.

Besides, a wireless sensing system is highly desired to enable facile monitoring of soft exoskeleton in real time, but is rarely investigated. Herein, wireless Ti3C2T x MXene strain sensing systems were fabricated by developing hierarchical morphologies on piezoresistive layers and incorporating regulatory resistors into circuit designs as well as integrating the sensing circuit with near-field communication (NFC) technology. The wireless MXene sensor system can simultaneously achieve an ultrahigh sensitivity (gauge factor ≥ 14,000) and reliable linearity (R2 ≈ 0.99) within multiple user-designated high-strain working windows (130\% to ≥900\%). Additionally, the wireless sensing system can collectively monitor the multisegment exoskeleton actuations through a single database channel, largely reducing the data processing loading.

abstract = {{Electronic textiles capable of sensing, powering, and communication can be used to non-intrusively monitor human health during daily life. However, achieving these functionalities with clothing is challenging because of limitations in the electronic performance, flexibility and robustness of the underlying materials, which must endure repeated mechanical, thermal and chemical stresses during daily use. Here, we demonstrate electronic textile systems with functionalities in near-field powering and communication created by digital embroidery of liquid metal fibers. Owing to the unique electrical and mechanical properties of the liquid metal fibers, these electronic textiles can conform to body surfaces and establish robust wireless connectivity with nearby wearable or implantable devices, even during strenuous exercise. By transferring optimized electromagnetic patterns onto clothing in this way, we demonstrate a washable electronic shirt that can be wirelessly powered by a smartphone and continuously monitor axillary temperature without interfering with daily activities. Electronic textiles should maintain performance against repeated mechanical, thermal and chemical stresses during daily activities. Here, authors demonstrate digital embroidery of robust liquid metal-based fibres with wireless functionalities.}},

abstract = {{Wireless interfaces enable brain-implanted devices to remotely interact with the external world. They are critical components in modern research and clinical neurotechnologies and play a central role in determining their overall size, lifetime and functionality. Wireless interfaces use a wide range of modalitiesincluding radio-frequency fields, acoustic waves and lightto transfer energy and data to and from an implanted device. These forms of energy interact with living tissue through distinct mechanisms and therefore lead to systems with vastly different form factors, operating characteristics, and safety considerations. This paper reviews recent advances in the development of wireless interfaces for brain neurotechnologies. We summarize the requirements that state-of-the-art brain-implanted devices impose on the wireless interface, and discuss the working principles and applications of wireless interfaces based on each modality. We also investigate challenges associated with wireless brain neurotechnologies and discuss emerging solutions permitted by recent developments in electrical engineering and materials science.

However, the efficiency of signal transmission is limited by the large reflection encountered at the interface between air and biological tissue. Here, we demonstrate an approach to overcome this reflection using cascaded metasurfaces with deeply subwavelength thickness to transform the wave impedance at the air-tissue interface. We develop a procedure to systematically synthesize these metasurfaces using multilayer tissue model that can account for different body compositions. Using this procedure, we design a three-layer metasurface operating at 2.45 GHz with λ/24.5 thickness. Full-wave simulations in a computational human body model show that the metasurface provides transmission equivalent to replacing the background with a tissue-matched medium, while experimental measurements demonstrate 12.1 dB enhancement of transmission into a multilayer tissue phantom.}},

However, their use during daily life is hindered by challenges such as environmental interference, low sensitivity, and non-ideal form factors. Here, we report a radio-frequency sensor made from a conductive textile that provides sensitive non-contact monitoring of vital signs. The sensor (13 cm2 in size) comprises a radial pattern of grooves that support spoof localized surface plasmon (LSP) modes and a ground plane with a complementary window that controls the sensor’s interaction with the body. These spoof LSP modes provide a sharp resonant dip and a broadly tunable evanescent field that enables tracking of heartbeat and respiration via the |S11| spectrum measured in a connector-free manner. We establish the optimal operating mode of the sensor and show that it provides a resonant frequency shift of 250 MHz for respiration and 100 MHz for heartbeat motions. Experiments with a healthy human subject show that the measured heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) are in close agreement with gold standard sensors and are robust to daily activities performed while sitting.}},

For ubiquitous sensing, flexible sensors are developed to overcome the limitations of conventional rigid counterparts. Despite rapid advancement in bench-side research over the last decade, the market adoption of flexible sensors remains limited. To ease and to expedite their deployment, here, we identify bottlenecks hindering the maturation of flexible sensors and propose promising solutions. We first analyze challenges in achieving satisfactory sensing performance for real-world applications and then summarize issues in compatible sensor-biology interfaces, followed by brief discussions on powering and connecting sensor networks. Issues en route to commercialization and for sustainable growth of the sector are also analyzed, highlighting environmental concerns and emphasizing nontechnical issues such as business, regulatory, and ethical considerations. Additionally, we look at future intelligent flexible sensors. In proposing a comprehensive roadmap, we hope to steer research efforts towards common goals and to guide coordinated development strategies from disparate communities.

Current strategies for noise mitigation rely primarily on reducing or removing noise. Here, we introduce stochastic exceptional points and show the utility to reverse the detrimental effect of noise. The stochastic process theory illustrates that the stochastic exceptional points manifest as fluctuating sensory thresholds that give rise to stochastic resonance, a counterintuitive phenomenon in which the added noise increases the system’s ability to detect weak signals. Demonstrations using a wearable wireless sensor show that the stochastic exceptional points lead to more accurate tracking of a person’s vital signs during exercise. Our results may lead to a distinct class of sensors that overcome and are enhanced by ambient noise for applications ranging from healthcare to the internet of things.}},

Current clinically-used approaches for wireless communication, however, do not support direct networking between implants because of signal losses from absorption and reflection by the body. As a result, existing examples of such networks rely on an external relay device that needs to be periodically recharged and constitutes a single point of failure. Here, we demonstrate direct implant-to-implant wireless networking at the scale of the human body using metamaterial textiles. The textiles facilitate non-radiative propagation of radio-frequency signals along the surface of the body, passively amplifying the received signal strength by more than three orders of magnitude (>30 dB) compared to without the textile. Using a porcine model, we demonstrate closed-loop control of the heart rate by wirelessly networking a loop recorder and a vagus nerve stimulator at more than 40 cm distance. Our work establishes a wireless technology to directly network body-integrated devices for precise and adaptive bioelectronic therapies. Implanted bioelectronic devices have proven useful for health sensing and therapy, while the interconnection of distributed implants remains challenging.
