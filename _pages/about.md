I work at the intersection of hardware and software, humans and technology. I am currently a research scientist at [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/) where I work on sensors and machine learning algorithms to digitize and represent humans.

I am also an Associate Professor on leave at [NUS](https://nus.edu.sg/) where I built wireless bioelectronic devices to sense and treat health disorders. I received my PhD from Stanford University where I developed wireless power technology now used in medical implants.
